approach of generating random numbers from sine function:
-can go into fixed point
-one we hit this same value twice the sequence repeats
-non linear 

approach of generating random numbers from sawtooth function:
-linear
-has fixed points

montecarlo methode:
No/N ~ Vo/V
No - number of points in circle
N  - number of points in total
Vo - Volme of circle
V  - total volume (we asume that it = 1)

r=1/2
center of circle O = (0,0)
